add a file for each openstack environment you would like to support with the OMF.

within each file, assure you have the following key value pairs:

host=openstack url
user=user
password=password
project=tenant
domain=domain


The environments file should list all environments.
I.E. with in environments file list every credentials file you add to this directory. One per line.

these files are read in a lists in ostackbase module to collect the credentials needed based on command line inputs to omf-osmgr.py
